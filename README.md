# **Case Description**

In 2022, 365 Company launched several new features on its platform to boost student engagement and foster growth. These updates were designed to enhance the learning experience and attract a larger audience. Some of the key additions included an XP system that enabled students to track their progress, level up, and earn rewards by completing various learning objectives.
These features aimed to create a more engaging and interactive platform, improve student satisfaction, and drive the companyâ€™s growth.

## **Objective**

The purpose of this Customer Engagement Analysis project is to evaluate the impact of these new platform features on student engagement. Using Excel, you will analyze key engagement metrics, such as:

- Participation rates.
- Retention trends.
- XP and leaderboard activity.
- Consistency in streaks.

  The goal is to determine whether these enhancements led to measurable improvements in user engagement and overall platform success.

## **Dataset Overview**

In this Customer Engagement Analysis project, we work with a masked and reduced dataset from 365 Data Science to ensure privacy and practicality while accurately reflecting company operations. The dataset includes:

- **student_id:** Unique identifiers for students with free or paid accounts in Q4 2021 and Q4 2022.
- **student_country:** Geographic information for analyzing regional or country-specific trends.
- **Paid:** Binary indicator of paid ('1') or free ('0') account status, highlighting subscription differences.
- **minutes_watched_21:** Engagement level based on minutes watched in Q4 2021.
- **minutes_watched_22:** Engagement level based on minutes watched in Q4 2022.

## **Analytical Methods**

In this project, we have leveraged the dataset to perform the following analyses:

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing the data with measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and data distribution to understand overall trends and patterns.
- **Confidence Intervals:** Estimating the range within which certain population parameters (e.g., average engagement levels) are likely to fall with a specified level of confidence.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Conducting statistical tests to compare engagement levels across groups (e.g., paid vs. unpaid users, Q4 2021 vs. Q4 2022) and determine if observed differences are statistically significant.
  
These analyses have provided actionable insights into customer behavior and engagement trends.

## **Conclusion**

This project aims to uncover meaningful insights from customer engagement data by employing statistical techniques such as descriptive analysis, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. Through these methods, we can better understand user behavior, identify trends, and support data-driven decision-making.
